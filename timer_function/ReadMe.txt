Countdown Timer
Nothing exceptional other than the added benefit of time.sleep() which pauses the program from running immediatetly after each parse.

User will enter time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Computer will do the math and produce a timer based on user input. It will then give user a 10 second window before begining the actual countdown.
